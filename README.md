# Hospital-Mortality-Prediction
Hospital Mortality Prediction Project: This project employs SQL-based analysis to predict mortality rates in hospital settings. Leveraging SQL's robust querying capabilities, we meticulously analyze patient data encompassing demographics, medical histories, and treatment records. By delving into this rich dataset, our goal is to develop accurate predictive models for patient outcomes.

Through comprehensive data exploration and feature engineering techniques, we identify key factors contributing to mortality risk. These factors may include patient age, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment interventions. Utilizing SQL queries, we extract, clean, and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

We then employ various statistical and machine learning techniques within SQL to develop predictive models. These models leverage historical patient data to forecast the likelihood of mortality for current patients. By continuously refining and validating our models, we ensure their reliability and effectiveness in real-world clinical scenarios.

Our project aims to provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights to support clinical decision-making. Early identification of patients at higher risk of mortality can facilitate timely interventions and personalized care plans. Furthermore, our predictive models serve as a tool for hospitals to optimize resource allocation and prioritize high-risk patients, thereby improving overall patient outcomes.

In conclusion, our Hospital Mortality Prediction Project harnesses the power of SQL to analyze patient data and develop accurate predictive models for mortality risk. By leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, we aim to empower healthcare professionals with actionable insights to enhance patient care and ultimately save lives.
